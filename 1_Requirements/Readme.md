## Introduction
Snake Water Gun is one of the famous two-player games played by many children. It is very much similar to the Stone Paper Scissor game. It is a game in which the player randomly chooses any of the three forms i.e. snake(S), water(W), and gun(G).
## Research
Here, we have implemented this game using the C random module, if-else statements, This C project is to build a game for a single player that plays with the computer . 
## Cost and Features and Timeline
The cost of the system is defined upon how many times the user wants to play the game.Features such as winning sound loosing sound and tie breaker sound can also be added to make the application little advanced. We can make this game interesting by making it playable online by increasing the user limit in database and also if somone leaves in between the game the plyaer automatically looses. Since this is an offline game and playable only between computer and user this game is free of cost.
## Rules of the Game
><p>These are the rules need to be followed while playing this game:</p>
    1.In the case of Snake vs. Water, Snake drinks the water hence wins.
    2.In the case of Water vs. Gun, The gun will drown in water, hence a point for water.
    3.In the case of Gun vs. Snake, Gun will kill the snake and win.
    4.In situations where both parties choose the same object, the result will be a draw.

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:
All Age Groups whomsoever wants to play with computer can play, Testing team and Developers improvise the code and play among themselves.

## What:
A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has only two possible outcomes: a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other. A player who decides to play Snake will beat another player who has chosen water ("As snake Drinks the water"]), but will lose to one who has gun ("gun will absorb water");.If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie. The type of game originated in China and spread with increased contact with East Asia, while developing different variants in signs over time.

## When:
when you want to come to an conclusion among your friends to get a winner.

## Where:
This type of game is played when there wont be any internet connection you have to just run the code and you can play without any software updates or not even installing excess files with huge storage capacity.

## How:
><p> 1.Select the no of times you want to play.</p>
><p> 2.Choose the options amnong S=Snake, W=Water, G=Gun</p>
